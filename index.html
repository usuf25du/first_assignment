            <p>I want to be a web developer for the next couple of months. I know it would not be an easy task to do. I have to concentrate on it. That is a very tough thing to do. But this time I am dedicated and serious about my goal. I will give enough time to solve problems as well as do my homework. I think if I work hard I will succeed in my journey.</p>

            <p><i>The oath for the new year is to do something better. Doing better is for myself, for the people closest to me, and for my country. It would be good for me if I could establish myself as a web developer in the new year. Technology is always new to me. It is nice to learn new things in technology. Learning is not always easy for me, but it is wise to use it when the opportunity comes. And that's what I'm doing now.</i></p>
